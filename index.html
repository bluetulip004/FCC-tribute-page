          <li>Made community secular</li>
          <li>Abolished caliph</li>
          <li>Abolished parishes</li>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Ataturk, with his historic achievements, was one of the greatest
            leaders of this century (20th). He was a towering figure of human
            ideals. His extraordinary leadership and his military genius
            accomplished so much for his country; first in battlefields, and
            then in building his nation, materially and in spirit. He created a
            modern and sovereign state from the ashes of a defeated empire. He
            was a great peace-maker, an ultimate reformer and a torch-bearer of
            freedom. He won not only the heart of his nation but the hearts of
            the oppressed nations as well. We all miss him."
